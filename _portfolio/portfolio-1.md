The primary goal of my internship at [View Systems](https://www.view.io) was to develop and maintain a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation pipeline for their LLM Assistant. They wanted to get an idea of the settings they would need for each individual user depending on the type of data they were using on their product. This required building an external RAG pipeline (from the UI) so that I could run largescale tests on data to evaluate performance. I had the opportunity to work with Founder and CEO Joel Christner and cofounder and Senior Member of Technical Staff and Software Engineer Blake Martz on this project.

## Evaluation criteria
Remember that each of the two projects in your portfolio will be evaluated on these points:

* **Length**: A summary of the project goals, technology used, and outcomes, as appropriate for a general technical audience, between 1000 and 3000 words (not counting code)
* **Content**: studentâ€™s experience demonstrates the learning outcomes for the MSHLT program [^note]
* **Code**: Code is contained in the site, or a link to the code (such as in a GitHub repository) exists on the site.
* **Professionalism**: Free of grammatical, mechanical, and stylistic issues
* **Above and beyond**: How well does this component communicate the most relevant features?

[^note]: The learning outcomes of the MSHLT program are:
    
    1. Students will demonstrate programming skills for the workplace.
    2. Students will be able to use fundamental algorithms and concepts in Natural Language Processing.
    3. Students will show knowledge of tools and packages used in Natural Language Processing.
