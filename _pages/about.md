I am a Master's of Science student at the University of Arizona in their [Human Language Technology program](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/ms-hlt). In 2023, I graduated cum laude from the University of Arizona with a BA in Linguistics and a minor in Computer Science.

My BA
======
In 2018, I tentatively dipped my toes back into school after having dropped out in 2010 due to feelings of aimlessness in my educational endeavors at the time. The much-needed years away allowed me to sharpen my interests, giving me space to confidently choose the direction I wanted to take. I have had a lifelong interest in language, nourished by a deep love for books and writing, though I had failed to recognize that as a viable area of study among the myriad interests of a 17-year-old brain.

As I prepared myself to return to the U of A by taking prerequisites at Pima Community College, I ran into a Ph.D. student who turned my attention to their HLT MS program. Already having had an interest in coding, it was an easy decision to declare C.S. as my minor, with the intention of finishing my BA and going on to the HLT Master's.

At the U of A, I was lucky to study semantics, syntax, phonetics, and other linguistic areas that I was surprised to find strongly support certain areas of computer science, especially as they relate to natural language processing. During my undergrad, I got to work with Dr. Sandiway Fong, the director of the in-person HLT program, on a Spanish syntactic parser he was working on. It was incredibly helpful to see some of the minutiae that go into building something as complex as a language parser, not to mention getting to work directly with someone so knowledgeable about computational linguistics.

My MS
======
In 2023, I began the HLT program at the U of A. I dug a little deeper on topics that I had started in my undergrad, such as human language technology, statistical natural language processing, and computational linguistics, while getting the opportunity to explore some new ones in speech technology and search engine optimization.

During this time, I was enlightened to the linguistic underbelly of machine learning. I was able to apply my knowledge of syntax and semantics to many projects in various classes, while learning a bit more about phonology and phonetics in speech tech.

For my internship, I got to work with Joel Christner and Blake Martz at their startup, [View Systems](https://www.view.io). There, I got to contribute to the development of their RAG evaluation pipeline and core prompt engineering. I tested their LLM Assistant to try and improve context retrieval strategies depending on the type of data being supplied to the RAG pipeline. Here, I got to explore the vast world of embedding and rerank models, implementing many of them as a means of improving retrieval to their Assistant.



Throughout my education, I have worked full-time at a few different spots, so my schedule was always pretty loaded. However, I tried my best to find time to do some of the things I love, including reading too-long fantasy/sci-fi series, getting out on the tennis court, and spending time with friends and family.
